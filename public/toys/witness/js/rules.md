# **RULES OF WITNESS ELEMENTS**
*Remember followings--color ones really bothered me :(* \
*Names of elements are freely given by myself, not by authority.*
## Point _(hexagons on lines)_
Need your route pass over the point.

## Splitter _(Round rectangles)_
Need area of each splitter only has ~~ANY ELEMENTS~~ splitters in only one color.

## Teamer _(8-angle polygons)_
Need area of each teamer has **exactly 2** teamers. \
(Any other element that has the same color with a teamer is considered as another teamer when a teamer processing its check.)

## Passer _(Triangles)_
Need <u>the count of times when your routes pass the block where the passer lays</u> equals to <u>the count of triangles of the passer</u>

## Tetris _(Literal Tetris)_
Need all the tetris-es that an area has could be put together in a certain order to become the shape of this area. \
For **Rotated Tetris**, that means this one piece Tetris could be rotated to match the shape of this area.\
For **Hollow Tetris**, that means this one piece Tetris is used to minus such a part from a put-together-ed shape.

## Remover _(Clovers)_
Need your solution **MUST INCORRECT**, but after the remover removing one elements of all in its area, your solution become correct.
